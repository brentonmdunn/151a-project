## Environment Setup

Create virtual environment:
```
python -m venv .venv
```

Activate virtual environment:
```
# Windows
.venv\Scripts\activate

# Mac/Linux
source .venv/bin/activate
```

Install dependencies:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Download data:

(1)
```python
python download_data.py
```
The path to where the data is will be printed to the console. 


(2) Or download from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kacpergregorowicz/house-plant-species).


The parent folder for the data should be called `house_plant_species`. Move the data (either with `mv` or with GUI) so that the file structure looks like the following:
- fa24-cse151a-project (current working directory)
  - house_plant_species
  - download_data.py
  - preprocessing.ipynb
  - requirements.txt

## Preprocessing Steps
We are working with an image dataset containing 14,790 images of varying quality, resolution, and size. Given these parameters, as well as the details gathered from our data exploration step, we plan to perform the following preprocessing steps to the dataset before training our model:

1. Check for and remove any corrupted images
   - We do not want corrupted input data to negatively impact our model during training
3. Resize images to 224x224 pixels
   - Having a consistent input size is crucial for our model to operate efficiently
4. Convert images to grayscale
   - This simplifies the image data, helping to reduce computational complexity
5. Create label encoding and one-hot encoding for each of the 47 plant classes
   - One-hot encoding is more commonly used for non-ordinal categories (such as our different plant classes), it is also more computationally expensive and may lead to the curse of dimensionality
   - Label-encoding is more general and could be more efficient, but may lead to unintentionally creating a false ordering of classes
   - We plan to experiment with both types of encoding to see which one makes the most sense for our use case
